# TODO List

- Add Expert Domain role  - needs a file from Hamza for PA classification 
    - Add expert opinion page, where they contribute to their specific PA classification
    - Expert users should only be able to add expert opinion
    - Expert users should only see the rows with missing opinion

- Sorry for the future soul that has having to maintain/refactor this cursed CSV "database" and that main.py and not properply .gitignoring stuff and....
  - Yes, I know it should've been a proper DB
  - No, I have no excuse
